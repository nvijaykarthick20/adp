Given an amount in Bills that can be (1,2,5,10,20,50,100) change it to coins that are (0.01,0.05,0.10,0.25). The machine needs to assume there is a finite number of coins.
 
Assumptions:
 
•	Start with 100 coins of each type (BONUS* - allow for number of coins to be configurable and easily changed if needed)
•	Prompt User for an amount they want to get change for. (BONUS* -  allow for direct rest service inputs as an alternative as well)
•	Catch bad input and display error messages or catch exceptions if applicable
•	Machine should return the least amount of coins possible (BONUS * - Allow for other routines like most amount of coins)
•	Machine should display a message if it does not have enough coins
•	Code should maintain the state of coins left throughout all the transaction till it runs out of the coin then it should exit.
•	Deliver the code with test cases
